## What is jbodys?

+ is a headless CMS

A content-oriented CMS consists of the backend and the frontend. 
This way, they both run as a monolithic system. 
It combines various modules and features and runs like one.


So when you run a jBodys as a headless system, both the content and the presentation are decoupled. 
As a headless system, the content presentation layer is flexible.

The backend can now be driven with raw data using APIs (application programming interface).


A headless CMS is any type of back-end content management system where the content repository "body" is separated or decoupled from the presentation layer "head"


Content that is housed in a headless CMS is delivered via APIs for seamless display across different devices.

Some traditional CMS platforms offer a "headless API” that allows you to send content to a separate presentation layer. 
They call this "headless” because the presentation layer is separated from the body.

One way to solve the limitations of a traditional CMS is by implementing a "headless” CMS — if the presentation layer of a website is the "head” of a CMS, then cutting off that presentation layer creates a headless CMS.

While this type of headless CMS enables you to choose an appropriate presentation layer for a digital platform, it doesn’t solve an underlying problem: structuring content so that it can be reused across different platforms and channels.

Headless architecture is a similar concept to a headless CMS, as it is a multichannel solution for effectively publishing dynamic content across a variety of platforms and devices. 

Content stored in a headless architecture is raw and unformatted, and its final presentation isn’t limited by a front-end system.

## Why

With the proliferation of digital platforms, enterprises are often crippled by a proliferation of CMS instances — dozens, or even hundreds. As a result, they have to duplicate content from a website CMS to an app CMS and then to a digital display CMS.
Unifies data into a single headless content hub

Content infrastructure eliminates endless copy and pasting work, enabling organizations to unify all content in a centralized content hub. This makes editing way easier — change the copy or image in one place, and that change applies everywhere the content is located. Unification improves brand consistency and compliance, and enables editors to nimbly update content across all channels, making campaigns a breeze.
Enables simultaneous collaboration

Content infrastructure also enables simultaneous collaboration, replacing the slow waterfall approach to development in favor of an agile framework where teams can work in parallel. This type of headless CMS offers a competitive advantage for enterprises that need to rapidly spin up new software, landing pages and microsites.

+ Makes content resources highly accessible and reusable

Lastly, content infrastructure makes reusability a breeze, a key component for making the most of resources spent on content creation. When all content is accessible for use on any digital platform, brands can make the most of features like personalization and localization.
